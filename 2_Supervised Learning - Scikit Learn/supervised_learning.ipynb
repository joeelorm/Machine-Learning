    "#### Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is the science and art of giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. For example, your computer can learn to predict whether an email is spam or not spam given its content and sender. Another example: your computer can learn to cluster, say, Wikipedia entries, into different categories based on the words they contain. It could then assign any new Wikipedia article to one of the existing clusters. Notice that, in the first example, we are trying to predict a particular class label, that is, spam or not spam. In the second example, there is no such label. When there are labels present, we call it supervised learning. When there are no labels present, we call it unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "Unsupervised learning, in essence, is the machine learning task of uncovering hidden patterns and structures from unlabeled data. For example, a business may wish to group its customers into distinct categories based on their purchasing behavior without knowing in advance what these categories maybe. This is known as clustering, one branch of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "There is also reinforcement learning, in which machines or software agents interact with an environment. Reinforcement agents are able to automatically figure out how to optimize their behavior given a system of rewards and punishments. Reinforcement learning draws inspiration from behavioral psychology and has applications in many fields, such as, economics, genetics, as well as game playing. In 2016, reinforcement learning was used to train Google DeepMind's AlphaGo, which was the first computer program to beat the world champion in Go.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, we have several data points or samples, described using predictor variables or features and a target variable. Our data is commonly represented in a table structure in which there is a row for each data point and a column for each feature. Taking the iris dataset for example, each row represents measurements of a different flower and each column is a particular kind of measurement, like the width and length of a certain part of the flower. The aim of supervised learning is to build a model that is able to predict the target variable, here the particular species of a flower, given the predictor variables, here the physical measurements. If the target variable consists of categories, like 'click' or 'no click', 'spam' or 'not spam', or different species of flowers, we call the learning task classification. Alternatively, if the target is a continuously varying variable, for example, the price of a house, it is a regression task. In this chapter, we will focus on classification. In the following, on regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on naming conventions: out in the wild, you will find that what we call a feature, others may call a predictor variable or independent variable, and what we call the target variable, others may call dependent variable or response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of supervised learning is frequently to either automate a time-consuming or expensive manual task, such as a doctor's diagnosis, or to make predictions about the future, say whether a customer will click on an add or not. For supervised learning, you need labeled data and there are many ways to get it: you can get historical data, which already has labels that you are interested in; you can perform experiments to get labeled data, such as A/B-testing to see how many clicks you get; or you can also crowdsourced labeling data which, like reCAPTCHA does for text recognition. In any case, the goal is to learn from data for which the right output is known, so that we can make predictions on new data for which we don't know the output. There are many ways to perform supervised learning in Python.We will use scikit-learn, or sklearn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python. It also integrates very well with the SciPy stack, including libraries such as NumPy. There are a number of other ML libraries out there, such as TensorFlow and keras.\n"

    "We'll be working with a dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository consisting of votes made by US House of Representatives Congressmen. Your goal will be to predict their party affiliation ('Democrat' or 'Republican') based on how they voted on certain key issues.

This is so that your focus can be directed towards understanding how to train and evaluate supervised learning models. \n",

Following this with some visual EDA will give you an even better understanding of the data. However, you may have noticed in the previous exercise that all the features in this dataset are binary; that is, they are either 0 or 1. So a different type of plot would be more useful here, such as Seaborn's `countplot`."

So the resulting plot shows the difference in voting behavior between the two parties for the 'education' bill, with each party colored differently. We manually specified the color to be 'RdBu', as the Republican party has been traditionally associated with red, and the Democratic party with blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like Democrats voted resoundingly against this bill, compared to Republicans. This is the kind of information that our machine learning model will seek to learn when we try to predict party affiliation solely based on voting behavior. An expert in U.S politics may be able to predict this without machine learning, but probably not instantaneously - and certainly not if we are dealing with hundreds of samples!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the IPython Shell, explore the voting behavior further by generating countplots for the 'satellite' and 'missile' bills, and answer the following question: Of these two bills, for which ones do Democrats vote resoundingly in favor of, compared to Republicans? Be sure to begin your plotting statements for each figure with `plt.figure()` so that a new figure will be set up. Otherwise, your plots will be overlayed onto the same figure."

    "#### Measuring Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification problems, accuracy is a commonly-used metric. The accuracy of a classifier is defined as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of data points. This begs the question though: which data do we use to compute accuracy? What we are really interested in is how well our model will perform on new data, that is, samples that the algorithm has never seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you could compute the accuracy on the data you used to fit the classifier. However, as this data was used to train it, the classifier's performance will not be indicative of how well it can generalize to unseen data. For this reason, it is common practice to split your data into two sets, a training set and a test set. You train or fit the classifier on the training set. Then you make predictions on the labeled test set and compare these predictions with the known labels. You then compute the accuracy of your predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we first import train test split from sklearn dot model selection. We then use the train test split function to randomly split our data. The first argument will be the feature data, the second the targets or labels. The test size keyword argument specifies what proportion of the original data is used for the test set. Lastly, the random state kwarg sets a seed for the random number generator that splits the data into train and test. Setting the seed with the same argument later will allow you to reproduce the exact split and your downstream results. train test split returns four arrays: the training data, the test data, the training labels, and the test labels. We unpack these into four variables: X train, X test, y train, and y test, respectively. By default, train test split splits the data into 75% training data and 25% test data, which is a good rule of thumb. We specify the size of the test size using the keyword argument test size, which we do here to set it to 30%. It is also best practice to perform your split so that the split reflects the the labels on your data. That is, you want the labels to be distributed in train and test sets as they are in the original dataset. To achieve this, we use the keyword argument stratify equals y, where y the list or array containing the labels. We then instantiate our K-nearest neighbors classifier, fit it to the training data using the fit method, make our predictions on the test data and store the results as y pred. Printing them shows that the predictions take on three values, as expected. To check out the accuracy of our model, we use the score method of the model and pass it X test and y test.\n",

    "Up until now, you have been performing binary classification, since the target variable had two possible outcomes.  We'll be working with the MNIST digits recognition dataset, which has 10 classes, the digits 0 through 9! A reduced version of the MNIST dataset is one of scikit-learn's included datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each sample in this scikit-learn dataset is an 8x8 image representing a handwritten digit. Each pixel is represented by an integer in the range 0 to 16, indicating varying levels of black. Recall that scikit-learn's built-in datasets are of type `Bunch`, which are dictionary-like objects. Helpfully for the MNIST dataset, scikit-learn provides an `'images'` key in addition to the `'data'` and `'target'` keys that you have seen with the Iris data. Because it is a 2D array of the images corresponding to each sample, this `'images'` key is useful for visualizing the images.\n",
    "On the other hand, the `'data'` key contains the feature array - that is, the images as a flattened array of 64 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that you can access the keys of these `Bunch` objects in two different ways: By using the `.` notation, as in `digits.images`, or the `[]` notation, as in `digits['images']`."

    "You will work with Gapminder data that we have consolidated into one CSV file available in the workspace as 'gapminder.csv'. Specifically, your goal will be to use this data to predict the life expectancy in a given country based on features such as the country's GDP, fertility rate, and population. \n",

    "Since the target variable here is quantitative, this is a regression problem. To begin, you will fit a linear regression with just one feature: 'fertility', which is the average number of children a woman in a given country gives birth to. \n",

    "Before that, however, you need to import the data and get it into the form needed by scikit-learn. This involves creating feature and target variable arrays. Furthermore, since you are going to use only one feature to begin with, you need to do some reshaping using NumPy's `.reshape()` method. "

    "#### Regression Mechanics\n",
    "We want to fit a line to the data and a line in two dimensions is always of the form `y = ax + b`, where `y` is the target, `x` is the single feature, and `a` and `b` are the parameters of the model that we want to learn. So the question of fitting is reduced to: how do we choose `a` and `b`? A common method is to define an error function for any given line and then to choose the line that minimizes the error function. Such an error function is also called a loss or a cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "What will our loss function be? Intuitively, we want the line to be as close to the actual data points as possible. For this reason, we wish to minimize the vertical distance between the fit and the data. So for each data point, we calculate the vertical distance between it and the line. This distance is called a residual. Now, we could try to minimize the sum of the residuals, but then a large positive residual would cancel out a large negative residual. For this reason we minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals! This will be our loss function and using this loss function is commonly called ordinary least squares, or OLS for short. Note that this is the same as minimizing the mean squared error of the predictions on the training set. When you call fit on a linear regression model in scikit-learn, it performs this OLS under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have two features and one target, a line is of the form `y = a1x1 + a2x2 + b`, so to fit a linear regression model is to specify three variables, `a1`, `a2`, and `b`. In higher dimensions, that is, when we have more than one or two features, a line of this form, so fitting a linear regression model is to specify a coefficient, `ai`, for each feature, as well as the variable, `b`. The scikit-learn API works exactly the same in this case: you pass the fit method two arrays: one containing the features, the other the target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "We split it into training and test sets; we instantiate the regressor, fit it on the training set and predict on the test set. We saw that, in the world of classification, we could use accuracy as a metric of model performance. The default scoring method for linear regression is called R squared. Intuitively, this metric quantifies the amount of variance in the target variable that is predicted from the feature variables. See the scikit-learn documentation and our statistics curriculum for more details. To compute the R squared, we once again apply the method score to the model and pass it two arguments: the test data and the test data target. Note that generally you will never use linear regression out of the box like this; you will most likely wish to use regularization."

    "#### Fit & predict for regression\n",
    "Now, you will fit a linear regression and predict life expectancy using just one feature. We will use the 'fertility' feature of the Gapminder dataset. Since the goal is to predict life expectancy, the target variable here is 'life'. The array for the target variable has been pre-loaded as y and the array for 'fertility' has been pre-loaded as X_fertility.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot with 'fertility' on the x-axis and 'life' on the y-axis has been generated. As you can see, there is a strongly negative correlation, so a linear regression should be able to capture this trend. Your job is to fit a linear regression and then predict the life expectancy, overlaying these predicted values on the plot to generate a regression line. You will also compute and print the  score using sckit-learn's .score() method."

    "#### Cross Validation\n",
    "If you're computing R squared on your test set, the R squared returned is dependent on the way that you split up the data! The data points in the test set may have some peculiarities that mean the R squared computed on it is not representative of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. To combat this dependence on what is essentially an arbitrary split, we use a technique called cross-validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by splitting the dataset into five groups or folds. Then we hold out the first fold as a test set, fit our model on the remaining four folds, predict on the test set, and compute the metric of interest. Next, we hold out the\n",
    "second fold as our test set, fit on the remaining data, predict on the test set, and compute the metric of interest. Then similarly with the third, fourth, and fifth fold. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result we get five values of R squared from which we can compute statistics of interest, such as the mean and median and 95% confidence intervals. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we split the dataset into five folds, we call this process 5-fold cross validation. If you use 10 folds, it is called 10-fold cross validation. More generally, if you use k folds, it is called k-fold cross validation or k-fold CV. There is, however, a trade-off as using more folds is more computationally expensive. This is because you are fittings and predicting more times. This method avoids the problem of your metric of choice being dependent on the train test split."

    "#### Regularized Regression\n",
    "What fitting a linear regression does is minimize a loss function to choose a coefficient ai for each feature variable. If we allow these coefficients or parameters to be super large, we can get overfitting. It isn't so easy to see in two dimensions, but when you have loads and loads of features, that is, if your data sit in a high-dimensional space with large coefficients, it gets easy to predict nearly anything. For this reason, it is common practice to alter the loss function so that it penalizes for large coefficients. This is called regularization. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first type of regularized regression that we'll look at is called ridge regression in which our loss function is the standard OLS loss function plus the squared value of each coefficient multiplied by some constant alpha. Thus, when minimizing the loss function to fit to our data, models are penalized for coefficients with a large magnitude: large positive and large negative coefficients, that is. Note that alpha is a parameter we need to choose in order to fit and predict. Essentially, we can select the alpha for which our model performs best. Picking alpha for ridge regression is similar to picking k in KNN. This is called hyperparameter tuning. This alpha, which you may also see called lambda in the wild, can be thought of as a parameter that controls model complexity. Notice that when alpha is equal to zero, we get back OLS. Large coefficients in this case are not penalized and the overfitting problem is not accounted for. A very high alpha means that large coefficients are significantly penalized, which can lead to a model that is too simple and ends up underfitting the data. The method of performing ridge regression with scikit-learn mirrors the other models that we have seen. We import Ridge from sklearn dot linear model, we split our data into test and train, fit on the training, and predict on the test. Note that we set alpha using the keyword argument alpha. Also notice the argument normalize: setting this equal to True ensures that all our variables are on the same scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another type of regularized regression called lasso regression, in which our loss function is the standard OLS loss function plus the absolute value of each coefficient multiplied by some constant alpha. One of the really cool aspects of lasso regression is that it can be used to select important features of a dataset. This is because it tends to shrink the coefficients of less important features to be exactly zero. The features whose coefficients are not shrunk to zero are 'selected' by the LASSO algorithm."

    "#### How good is your model?\n",
    "In classification, we've seen that you can use accuracy, the fraction of correctly classified samples, to measure model performance. However, accuracy is not always a useful metric. Consider a spam classification problem in which 99% of emails are real and only 1% are spam. I could build a model that classifies all emails as real; this model would be correct 99% of the time and thus have an accuracy of 99%, which sounds great. However, this naive classifier does a horrible job of predicting spam: it never predicts spam at all, so it completely fails at its original purpose. The situation when one class is more frequent is called class imbalance because the class of real emails contains way more instances than the class of spam. This is a very common situation in practice and requires a more nuanced metric to assess the performance of our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the \"class of interest\" is called the positive class. As we are trying to detect spam, this makes spam the positive class. Which class you call positive is really up to you. So why do we care about the confusion matrix? First, notice that you can retrieve accuracy from the confusion matrix: it's the sum of the diagonal divided by the total sum of the matrix. There are several other important metrics you can easily calculate from the confusion matrix. Precision, which is the number of true positives divided by the total number of true positives and false positives. It is also called the positive predictive value or PPV. In our case, this is the number of correctly labeled spam emails divided by the total number of emails classified as spam. Recall, which is the number of true positives divided by the total number of true positives and false negatives. This is also called sensitivity, hit rate, or true positive rate. The F1-score is defined as two times the product of the precision and recall divided by the sum of the precision and recall, in other words, it's the harmonic mean of precision and recall. To put it in plain language, high precision means that our classifier had a low false positive rate, that is, not many real emails were predicted as being spam. Intuitively, high recall means that our classifier predicted most positive or spam emails correctly."

    "#### Metrics for classification\n",
    "You evaluated the performance of your k-NN classifier based on its accuracy. However, accuracy is not always an informative metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will dive more deeply into evaluating the performance of binary classifiers by computing a confusion matrix and generating a classification report. in the example, the support was the number of Republicans or Democrats in the test set on which the classification report was computed. The precision, recall, and f1-score columns, then, gave the respective metrics for that particular class. Here, you'll work with the PIMA Indians dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict whether or not a given female patient will contract diabetes based on features such as BMI, age, and number of pregnancies. Therefore, it is a binary classification problem. A target value of 0 indicates that the patient does not have diabetes, while a value of 1 indicates that the patient does have diabetes."
