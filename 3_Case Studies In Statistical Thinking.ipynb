    "#### Acitivity of Zebra Fish and Melatonin\n",
    "In this study, the researchers in Prof. Prober's lab studied the activity of zebrafish larvae. Each fish was put in its own little well and recorded with a camera. Whenever a fish moves, the system detects and records the movement, indicated here by the red flashes in the video. The more movement, the more wakeful the fish. These fish are interesting because some of them have a mutation in a gene involved in producing melatonin, an important hormone for sleep regulation. Fish that have the mutation are called mutants, and those that do not are called wild type. If we look at the mean activity of the fish over time, we see that compared to wild type the mutant fish are more active at night, which is indicated by the gray regions on the plot. Our goal with this warm-up analysis is to quantify the effect of this mutation on wakefulness. We will use nighttime active bouts as a metric for wakefulness of the fish. An active bout is a period of time where a fish is consistently active. The *length* of an active bout is the number of consecutive minutes that a fish is active. \n",
    "Generically speaking, a probability distribution is a mathematical description of outcomes. But they are easier to think about as stories. Here, I will review the Exponential distribution. Its story has to do with Poisson processes. For a Poisson process, the timing of an event, called an \"arrival,\" is completely independent of when the previous event arrived. The waiting time between arrivals is Exponentially distributed."
